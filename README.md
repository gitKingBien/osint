Social Media OSIT

I like using the theHarvester tool as I love demontrating it to my students.

I used to enjoy using theHarvester, but a certain functionality was removed (google source was removed). Therefore, I created a customized version based of the tool that includes only the specific functionality I require.

theHarvester combined with my nick name Bien, hence theHarbienster :)

theHarbienster will search your input using Google Advanced Search in the following social media platforms: Linkedin, twitter, facebook and instagram

(e.g. site:facebook.com "batman")



=================================================
Common search techniques
        Search social media

        Put @ in front of a word to search social media. For example: @twitter.
        Search for a price

        Put $ in front of a number. For example: camera $400.
        Search hashtags

        Put # in front of a word. For example: #throwbackthursday
        Exclude words from your search

        Put - in front of a word you want to leave out. For example, jaguar speed -car
        Search for an exact match

        Put a word or phrase inside quotes. For example, "tallest building".
        Search within a range of numbers

        Put .. between two numbers. For example, camera $50..$100.
        Combine searches

        Put "OR" between each search query. For example, marathon OR race.
        Search for a specific site

        Put "site:" in front of a site or domain. For example, site:youtube.com or site:.gov.
        Search for related sites

        Put "related:" in front of a web address you already know. For example, related:time.com.
        See Googleâ€™s cached version of a site

        Put "cache:" in front of the site address.

        Important: Not all search operators return exhaustive results.
